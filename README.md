### Justin Bender

As a former professional skydiver with over 5,000 jumps under my belt, I
have developed a keen understanding of the importance of precision,
teamwork, and adaptability. These qualities have translated well into my
experience working in technology, where I have excelled in various roles
such as software development, 3D printing, CAD modeling.

Honestly I love all things software. I'd like to share the material I
create and use to learn with everyone. Please, enjoy and use how you see
fit.
